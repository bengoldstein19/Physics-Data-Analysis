Downloading the file:
  MAC USERS:
    Download atom to your machine, or another source code editor if you prefer
    open the terminal
    Visit https://brew.sh/ in your browser and copy the long code thing into your terminal and press enter
    follow the prompts to install homebrew
    Next, once that completes, type "brew install python" into the commandline and press enter
    Open atom
    Create a new project folder through file >> add new project folder >> new folder >> open
    Name it something appropriate
    Right click the folder in the left sidebar
    Click new file, and enter __anythingyouwant__.py into the path field
    Copy and paste the code from analysis.py into your file
    You now have the code downloaded to your machine, but there are still a couple more steps
  PC USERS:
    Figure it out

Dealing with file paths:
  For line 5, acquire the file path of your six flags csv file
    MAC USERS:
      Locate the file in finder
      Right click or control click on the file in finder to display a menu
      Hold down the option key
      Click "copy file as pathname"
      Paste into the single quoted section of line 5 thurrently contains '/Users/bengoldstein/Downloads/scrambler-acc.csv'
    PC USERS:
      Google how the heck to do it
  For line 59, enter the desired path of the file to which you would like the data written
    if the file doesn't currently exist, the program will create it
    In order to do this, change the name of the file from __yourname__.csv to __anythingelse__.csv
    This will create a file in the same location as your six flags file with the new name of your choice


Running the code:
  You will need to install the script package from atom in order to run the code
  Open preferences through Atom >> preferences
  click install from the list on the left
  search script and click install for the top one (should be by rgbkrk)
  You are now ready to run the code!  Return to the tab with your file in it, press cmd S to save, then cmd I to run
  After the program finishes, check the location of your six flags file for another file with the name you entered in line 59
  Open that file, and all of the refined data should be there!
  You can then create charts and scatter plots of the data, but to save it you must press save as and save it as a different file format (not csv)


Supplemental resources:
  The simulation.py file was written by mrs. ireland (RIP), but requires the installation of many dependencies through the terminal
  The following link is a visual simulation in desmos graphing calculator that I made.  https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ashieowkfp
